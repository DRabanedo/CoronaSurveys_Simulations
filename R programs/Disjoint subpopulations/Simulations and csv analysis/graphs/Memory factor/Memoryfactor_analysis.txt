### Graphs from Simulation_memoryfactor ##

* This graphs represent the bias, standard error, mse (mean squared error) and absolute error of the simulation without including any bias except the variance of the variable we are analysing ("memory factor"). 

* This variable represents the memory bias that every person has when is asked to record how big his personal network is (Reach variable). In this case, to represent this bias, we introduce a random disturbance generated by a normal. 
-> If someone has d_i connections (extracted from the graph which defines the social network), we choose a nearby random value as follows:
\hat(d)_i = rnorm(1, mean = d_i, sd = d_i*memory_factor)

* The "survey value" (\hat(d)_i) is the value that is used to make the estimate, so its precision will depend on how much differs the "survey value" and the real value (d_i) and how sensitive the estimator we are using is to these variations.

As we see, this estimator is very sensitive
