### Graphs from Simulation_networkprobability ##

This graphs represent the bias, standard error, mse (mean squared error) and absolute error of the simulation without including
any bias except the variance of the variable we are analysing (p = "network probability"). This variable represents the probability 
of randomizing a connection once we have built the regular graph which represent the population network. Then, when p=0
we have a regular graph where each node is connected to his closest 150 neighbours.

Example: Since we have 10000 nodes, when p = 0:
     - Node 1 is connected to nodes 2-76 and 9926-10000
     - Node 2 is connected to nodes 3-77 and 9927-10000 and 1
     ...
     - Node 10000 is connected to nodes 1-75 and 9925-9999

When p != 0, we randomize each one of the connections made with pobability p, obtaining more irregularity as p increases. Then, when 
p = 1, we work with an irregular graph, also known as Erdős–Rényi model.


### Graph analysis ###

As we see in the four graphs, we can conclude that the degree of randomization does not affect the prediction of the hidden population
for none of the estimators since it is almost constant as the parameter varies.
