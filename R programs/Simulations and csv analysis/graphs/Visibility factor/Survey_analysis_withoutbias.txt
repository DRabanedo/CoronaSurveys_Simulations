### Graphs from Simulation_visibilityfactor ##

This graphs represent the bias, standard error, mse (mean squared error) and absolute error of the simulation without including
any bias except the variance of the variable we are analysing (visibility factor). 


### Graph analysis ###

The visibility factor represents one of the bias that we have to correct if we want a good estimate of the hidden population number.
In all this graphs we see the importance of this value, obtaining bias estimates when we do not apply the correct correction.
The only estimator that stays almost constant with the variance of the visibility factor is the GNSUM, as it is not affected by this
bias due to the second survey (direct survey) we make to the hidden population.
