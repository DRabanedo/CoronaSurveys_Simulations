### Graphs from Simulation_networkneighbours ##

This graphs represent the bias, standard error, mse (mean squared error) and absolute error of the simulation without including
any bias except the variance of the variable we are analysing ("network neighbours"). This variable represents the number of "neighbours"
that has every node before the randomization (see "Network probability" for further explanations).


### Graph analysis ###

As we see in the four graphs, we can conclude that the number of neighbours affects the prediction of the hidden population. As the bias graph 
shows, the estimate of the hidden population gets better as the parameter grows. 

Despite we can not control this parameter in a real world problem, as it is intrinsic to the network structure, it is an interesting finding.
