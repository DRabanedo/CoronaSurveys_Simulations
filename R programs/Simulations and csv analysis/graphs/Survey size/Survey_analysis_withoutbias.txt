### Graphs from Simulation_surveysize ##

This graphs represent the bias, standard error, mse (mean squared error) and absolute error of the simulation without including
any bias except the variance of the variable we are analysing (n = survey_size). 


### Graph analysis ###

We are running the simulation with higher values for the survey's size (1-9995) to observe the real convergence (or non convergence) of 
all the estimators.
