### Graphs from Simulation_visibilityfactor ##

This graphs represent the bias, standard error, mse (mean squared error) and absolute error of the simulation without including
any bias except the variance of the variable we are analysing (visibility factor). 


### Graph analysis ###

The visibility factor represents one of the bias that we have to correct if we want a good estimate of the hidden population number.
In all this graphs we see the importance of this value, obtaining bias estimates when we do not apply the factor correction 
- Estimators with visibility factor correction: Nh_basicvis_mean, Nh_basicvis_sum, Nh_MLEvis, Nh_PIMLEvis.
- Estimators without visibility factor correction: Nh_basic_mean, Nh_basic_sum, Nh_MLE, Nh_PIMLE.

## IMPORTANT WARNING ##
-> We make the correction with the true value of the visibility factor, and in real cases we really do not know its value, so it
should be estimated. There are several techniques to make this depending on the survey general estructure and the proyect budget.

The only estimator that stays almost constant with the variance of the visibility factor is the GNSUM due to his structure, so it
seems to be the only who is truly unbiased.
